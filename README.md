Hello thereðŸ‘‹
As a long-time fan of the tech industry and a passionate developer, i am so elated seeing young folks like me come up with very good and really cool websites. I have 4 years experience in HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT, combined with my internship with MEDIAAFRICA in front-end web development.

My journey as a front end developer has been really great to be honest, ups and downs, days where it'd take me weeks to just get my codes right but still i kept on going. I'd rather build that websites and fail as many times till i get it and show results than not trying it at all. During my internship with @mediaafrica i gained access with experience coding websites and applications which up till now still helps alot. I am self-assured that i have the skills to help both small and large business succeed even more better.

I am dedicated to building user friendly easy to use web apps. Always inspired by the work of others, it has really helped me in lot of ways, I'd love to use my experience in web development and passion to building imaginative solutions for comapanies. As a young Web developer, i code, design build websites for clients. My latest projects, i redesigned a websites which help increase my skills. 

I am constantly seeking out new technologies and staying up to date on trends in the industry.

Thank you for taking out of your time to review. I look forward to sharing more about my experience  and skills. Also feel free to reach out to me. Thank you.
